Hello, these are some of my solutions for Advent of Code 2020. I only started saving my solutions on day 17. Some of the code quality is genuinely terrible because I was using IDLE, but I still wanted to save my work as it was a significant amount of effort. I finally started using PyCharm on day 22.
